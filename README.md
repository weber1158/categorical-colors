## Why Categorical Colors?
The best way to visualize categorical data (<small>AKA</small> "qualitative data") is to use perceptually distinct colors that make it easy to distinguish between groups.

There are many color palettes that can be found on the MATLAB File Exchange; however, most of these color palettes are designed for visualizing continuous, diverging, or circular data. Meanwhile, very few *categorical* color palettes are available, and the most popular ones are not often found in a common repository.

Categorical Colors provides MATLAB users with quick and easy access to dozens of popular categorical color palettes, including the publication-worthy palettes by Cynthia Brewer and Fabio Crameri.

### Key Features
* Choose from 36 unique categorical color palettes.
* Access any of the color palettes using the `cat_colors` function.
* Add a categorical colorbar to figures, with labels, using the `cat_colorbar` function.
